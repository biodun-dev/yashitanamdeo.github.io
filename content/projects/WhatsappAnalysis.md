Personal project: Dive into the vibrant world of digital art with our NFT Marketplace, designed to facilitate the seamless trading of non-fungible tokens. Built using NextJs for a modern, server-side rendered interface, NodeJs for robust server operations, EthereumJs for secure blockchain interactions, MongoDB for efficient data storage, and SCSS for sleek styling. This platform offers a dynamic and user-friendly environment for both creators and collectors to buy, sell, and explore unique digital assets.
